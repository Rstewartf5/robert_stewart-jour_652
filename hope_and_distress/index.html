        <strong>unlight</strong> seeped in from the floor-to-ceiling windows in the spacious meeting room on the 2nd floor of the Rockville Memorial Library. The warmish light made the wintry day seem deceptively more mild than reality. Sara Vaziri, 43, a Rockville-based hairstylist choked on a sob as she brought her hands to her face.</p> 

         <p> “This is beyond inhumane!” she exclaimed. 
          
          “Look at the picture,” she said holding up her phone. “They shot him.” </p>
          
         <p> Vaziri displayed an image of Khodanoor Lajai.  Khodanoor was a victim of “Bloody Friday” – a massacre carried out by Islamic Republic of Iran’s security forces against protesters that resulted in the killing and wounding of dozens, according to Human Rights Watch. A picture was published and circulated on social media of the alleged torture that precipitated his death. </p>
          
         <p>In the picture, he is sitting barefoot on a cement block tied to a flagpole – a cup of water out of his reach. People believe he was held there overnight thirsty, dying, and taunted with the cup of water, explained Vaziri. </p> 
          
         <p> “You cannot treat other humans as…I have so much respect for animals, but I don’t know how else to describe it,” she continued. </p>
          
         <p>The protests that led to Bloody Sunday were one in several protests that swept Iran beginning in September 2022. The government used brutal force to quell the dissent, resulting in over 529 killed and over 19,700 arrested, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran as of February 17, 2023. Protestors there were calling for an end to the Islamic Republic and for a free and secular government, and the majority of Iranians likely support such a movement, according to the <a href="https://www.institute.global/insights/geopolitics-and-security/protests-and-polling-insights-streets-iran-how-removal-hijab-became-symbol-regime-change" target="_blank">Ton Blair Institute for Global Change.</a> </p>

         <p class="caption">Chart showing the number of deaths per province in Iran in the wake of the women, life, freedom protests. </p>


         <p>Protests began in response to the death of a young Kurdish woman in Iranian capital, Tehran.  On Tuesday September 13th, 2022 Mahsa Amini, was thrown into a van for allegedly wearing her headscarf too loose. After being detained, Amini was transported to a detention center. There is no credible official account of what happened on the van ride to the station, but at the station she collapsed. She was taken to the hospital, where she fell into a coma. There, three days later on September 16th she died. Her arrest and death led to protests calling for justice and a new government in Iran. </p>
          
          <p>The turmoil in Iran has led to a silent crisis plaguing Iranian Americans across the state. Social media has disseminated images and videos of violence and brutality that has distressed and outraged many in Maryland's Iranian American communities. </p>
          
          <p>Iranian American Marylanders are coping in a variety of ways with the traumatic media they’ve witnessed emanating from Iran. Some are protesting to raise awareness for the situation in Iran, as organizations like National Solidarity Group Iran have organized six months of protests across Maryland, Washington and Virginia. Protestors express a desire to play a part in ridding Iran of the clerical rule and establishing a secular democracy in the country. Others cope in silence but say the news from Iran is still a source of distress.</p>

          <br>

          <p class = "chapter_head" id="protest">Coping through public protest </p>
          <p>Vaziri is one of several Marylanders that has been protesting for nearly 6 months. Volunteering with DC-area National Solidarity Group (NSG) Iran, she has participated in rallies and attempted to contact local politicians. Sometimes hundreds show up to the local protests. Sometimes thousands come, including well-known Hollywood celebrities like Shohreh Agdashloo and Nazanin Boniadi. Being active with the group has helped her cope with the emotional distress caused by the news she consumes regarding protests and government surpression in Iran.</p>

          <p>“It’s like my meditation every Saturday when I go to the protests. It’s like I let the anger out. When we shout our slogans. When I’m doing stuff for our team. It’s like a meditation for me.” Vaziri said that she participated in the first candelight vigil in Washington D.C., to honor the death of Mahsa Amini, and has been participating since. </p>

          <p>Vaziri said that she believes greater solidarity from non-Iranians people could positively impact change and provide a sense of comfort to Iranian Americans. 

          For her, the more people show up the less likely the voices of Iranian Americans could be ignored.  She said that local politicians and local media are ignoring the US-based protests, and she does not understand why. “You cannot ignore 20 weeks of protest,” she said. “Every Saturday in DC. A huge amount of people shows up. You cannot ignore that, but they have been ignoring us. None of them respond,” she siad, “and there is no coverage on mainstream TV.”  

          “People can find out about our weekly protests on our social media - @NSGIRAN. Our website is woman-life-liberty.com,” she explained, when asked how readers could learn more. </p>

          <p>“All Iranian people are in pain now. They all hope for a new government. They all hope for a new government that can get along with other countries. They want to have a regular life,” said Javid 44, of Potomac. Javid whose name has been changed, asked for anonymity to protect friends and family still inside of Iran.</p>

          <p>An engineer by profession and a musician in his spare time Javid arrived in Maryland in 2019 – ten years after first arriving in the United States. Like Vaziri – Javid grew up in Tehran and has many fond moments of the capital. Before Maryland he lived in several states with very small Persian populations, so coming to Maryland meant reconnecting socially with a more vibrant Iranian community. “After 3 years in Maryland I feel like I like it here. I’m not going to move anywhere else.” </p>
          
          <p>Maryland has a small but thriving Iranian population socially connected with Iranian communities in Washington and Northern Virginia. According to American Community Survey estimates from 2021, there are roughly 16,600 Iranian Americans in the state. There are close to 20,000 in Virginia and 2,500 in Washington D.C. The state with the largest Persian American population is California, with roughly 210,000 people. Iranians emigrated from Iran after the 1979 revolution occurred that overthrew the country’s monarchy. Many resettled in the United States. </p>

          <br>
          
          <p>Like Vaziri and others, the death of Mahsa Amini and the subsequent protests in Iran marked a rupture in his life. Javid – who never followed the news before, now began feverishly following the news emanating from Iran via social media.</p>
          
          <p>“Since this happened in Iran a couple of months ago, I check [the news] every day. Just as a habit, and I got sick. I got sick. Like physically sick.” He said he knows the news was the source of his anguish but describes struggling to distance himself from the news. Videos of police beating people in the street made him imagine himself as the victim. “I tried not to…I mean you can’t stop. You open the Instagram and all of a sudden you see someone is dead or they killed someone. It’s just not easy to ignore," he said. </p>

          <p>Dr. Fereshteh Darya, is a psychotherapist and licensed clinical professional counselor who has worked for over 20 years with patients in Maryland including members of the Persian community. Coming herself from a Persian speaking background, Darya has personal insight into the Persian community and professional – some of her clients prefer engaging with her in Farsi, the official language of Iran. </p>
          
          <p>Darya spoke about  the challenges Iranian Americans face in coping with the turmoil coming out of Iran. “This is a challenge,” she said, “a huge challenge for the Iranian community in general, because it’s impacting everyone in some way.” “People …are witnessing hurtful, painful suffering of (other) people. It’s really difficult for all of us to witness something like this – day after day,” she said. </p>

          <p>Darya encourages her clients to develop a survival strategy for coping with the crisis. “One day it will end,” she said, but until then she believes people have limited psychological and emotional energy and that its best to develop a strategy. “We cannot easily remove the stressful situation, but we can work around the circumstances to alleviate the pain, as much as we can.”</p>
            
          <p>For her, a strategy involving understanding our own internal resources – our often untapped “inner excellence” and our needs can ensure that Iranian Americans take care of their own mental health first. She emphasized that people also have external resources including friends, family, people in the community, wise and thoughtful elders. She said that counseling is an excellent resource for individuals trying to understand how to tap into their internal and external strengths. </p>
 
            
          <p>Javid, who himself sought therapy at one point, has turned to playing music to cope with the stress of learning about the seemingly incessant brutal crackdown in Iran. Even going to the protests has become challenging for him.</p>
          
          <p>“You know when they say, ‘death to the Islamic regime.’ I mean everyone agrees with that, but I don’t know if saying it 100 times gives (me) any consolation.” Music is his therapeutic approach to processing the pain of the past months. </p>

            <br>
            <p class="chapter_head" id="hope"> For some, the crisis in Iran means hope for the future of the country </p>

            <p>While Javid has turned to music, Khatereh Borhani-Plesnik, 47, uses social media to channel her energy and cope with the ongoing crisis. Borhani-Plesnik lives in Rosedale and has many occupations including a makeup artist. She’s been in the Baltimore area for over 33 years. Her family came to Maryland after leaving Iran in the late 1980s. Farsi was her first language, and Borhani-Plesnik remembers struggling with expressing basic concepts using English. It wasn’t until her last two years of high school that she began to feel more confident expressing herself, and now with "the revoluition" happening in Iran, self-expression has become critical to her. 
              
            <p>“Anytime I hear about something in Iran I try to share it as much as possible,” she said. </p>

            <p>Borhani-Plesnik is prolific on social media, sharing news from Iran and connecting with other like-minded individuals. “This movement is very important to me, because I know it’s the end, and I want to help to push them off the cliff,” she said. </p>
            
            <p>Born in 1976, Borhani-Plesnik was old enough upon immigrating that she still maintains strong memories of Iran. One of her fondest memories was celebrating a holiday called “Noruz” the Persian New Year.</p>
            
            <p>The Persian Calendar is different than the one we use in the west, and the new year marks the beginning of Spring. The blossoming of flowers and sprouting of herbs that accompanies springtime is also associated with old religious beliefs regarding the conquest of good over evil.</p>
            
            <p>"The smells and the freshness of everything and the joy and the happiness people had,” she recounted, the pace of her speech quickening with enthusiasm. “It’s like a 13 -day celebration, and at the end of the 13 days, everyone goes out there [into nature] and has a picnic.” </p>
            
            <p>For her, no amount of celebration stateside tops the spirit of festivity back in Iran. “People are excited, they want to buy new clothes, they visit each other’s homes, they clean their homes, there’s like this anticipation for this new day.”</p>
            
            <p> Noruz is  a few weeks away, and it is a holiday of hope. But, Borhani-Plesnik said it will be hard to fully embrace the holiday given the circumstances in Iran. "If the revolution hasn’t gone full blown, and these people are not off the cliff, I don’t think people are going to be as joyful as they normally are," she said, referring to what she hopes will be the collapse of the theocratic regime in Iran responsible for the brutal supression of the Iranian protests. "There’s that mentality in Iran if all of these horrible things are happening, and there’s people dying, we don’t have time to celebrate," she added. 
              
            <p>Despite the crisis, Borhani-Plesnik is hopeful that in the new Persian year, the Iranian people will be free of the regime. "With all my heart I wish that Iran will be free," she said. </p> 
            
            <p> She sees hope in the actions of the women of Iran. “The burning and destroying of women’s headscarves gives me hope because this," she reached to her head to signal she was talking about the headscarf, "is a symbol of oppression for the women in Iran, she said. Borhani-Plesnik is particularly proud of Iranian women at this moment and the fearlessness they’ve demonstrated fighting for their rights. “Iranian women are lionhearted. They’re educated. They’re passionate. They are fearless, and they will protect their loved ones with their nails and teeth.”  
            </p>

            <p>I’ve been waiting for it. I’ve always been proud of Iran, but I want the Iranians themselves to be proud of themselves and proud of the country that they have," she said. "I want people to wish to go to Iran to visit because it’s such an amazing country.”</p>
